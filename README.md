## Deployment

Deploy your application to GitHub Pages.

- Create a new repository on GitHub

- In your terminal, run this command (replace `username` and `repository-name` with your data):

       git remote add origin https://github.com/<GitHub-username>/<repository-name>.git

- Add angular-cli-ghpages by running

       ng add angular-cli-ghpages

- To build your application, run the command (replace <repository-name> with your own repository name)

       ng deploy --base-href=/<repository-name>/

- The URL of your application will be then `https://<GitHub-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

Whenever you make any changes to your application's code, all you need to do is run the command:

       ng deploy --base-href=/<repository-name>/
